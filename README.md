Interpretable Kernel Dimensionality Reduction 

***

## Description
Interpretable Kernel Dimensionality Reduction is a supervised technique similar to linear discriminant analysis. Instead of working with the feature space, the data is first projected to a low dimension subspace. Since this projection is linear, it is interpretable. Once projected into the lower dimension subspace, it is then projected again into the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).  


### Code Instructions
You will need to install numpy, pytorch, sklearn. 
Example of how to run this code is in SDR_examply.py
